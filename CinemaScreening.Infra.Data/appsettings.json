 NOTE: Have tried to access the appsetting.josn file through Microsoft.Extension.Configuration from connectionHelper class, the configuration is not building and its not allowing to 
      add .AddJsonFile extension in .net class library (CinemaScreening.Infra.Data) and  _connectionString is loading with null. 
      The appsettings.json/App.config files are not getting loaded into the configuration for .net class library project.

NOTE: To access the connectionString, have registered connectionString through dependencyInjection.

Public static class ConnectionHelper
{
   public static IConfiguration Configuration { get; set; }

   private static string _connectionString; 
   
   public static string GetConnectionString()
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(_connectionString))
        {
            var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
           		     .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json");
            Configuration = builder.Build();
            _connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("CinemaScreeningDB");
